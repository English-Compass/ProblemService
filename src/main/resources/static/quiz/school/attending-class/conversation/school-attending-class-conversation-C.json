The intersection could reveal new insights about power structures in digital knowledge production.",

        "options": [
            "Thank you for this important epistemological question. I address these paradigmatic tensions through pragmatic pluralism, where I acknowledge the different truth claims while focusing on methodological complementarity to provide richer insights than either approach alone could offer.",
